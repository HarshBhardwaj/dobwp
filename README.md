# React & Node web app #

This is the first react web application using node to serve the files. We want to use `/api` to fetch data and serve that to clients.

## Setup ##

You will need to have node installed. 

After cloning the repo, you will need to run:
- `npm run build`
- `cd client` and run `npm start`
- Open new terminal, be in the root directory of the project and run `npm start`
